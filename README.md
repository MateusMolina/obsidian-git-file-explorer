This plugin integrates Obsidian's file explorer with Git. Once the plugin is enabled, you will see relevant Git information next to Git repositories found in your vault in the file explorer.

## Features

- Number of changed files displayed next to each detected repository in the file explorer
- Clicking on the component automatically stages and commits all changes in a sync commit with the message "Sync {ISO-TIMESTAMP}"
